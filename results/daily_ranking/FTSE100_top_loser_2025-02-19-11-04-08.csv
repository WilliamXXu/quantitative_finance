*   **Other analysts have also adjusted their ratings** for Antofagasta. Bernstein analysts upgraded the stock from ""Market Perform"" to ""Outperform,"" citing the company's attractive valuation and growth prospects, particularly related to the potential approval of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to extend the life of the Los Pelambres and Zaldivar mines. Canaccord Genuity analysts also upgraded the stock from ""Hold"" to ""Buy.""
*   **Antofagasta announced a final dividend** for 2024 of 23.5 cents per ordinary share, payable on May 12, 2025.

It appears the positive change in Antofagasta's stock price is likely due to the combination of these factors: JPMorgan's upgrade, other positive analyst ratings, and the announcement of a dividend payment.
