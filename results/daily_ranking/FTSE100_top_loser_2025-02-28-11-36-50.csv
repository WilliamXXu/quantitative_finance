*   **Reinstated Dividend:** Rolls-Royce announced it would reinstate dividend payments for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, at 6p per share.
*   **Share Buyback Program:** The company launched a £1 billion share buyback program.
*   **Increased Profit Guidance:** Rolls-Royce raised its profit guidance for the year, expecting adjusted operating profit to be in the range of £2.7 billion to £2.9 billion, up from the previous forecast of £2.5 billion to £2.8 billion.

However, I can provide some general factors that often influence stock price changes, especially for a company like Persimmon Plc, a UK-based housebuilder:

*   **Company-Specific News:** This could include announcements about earnings, new projects, changes in leadership, or significant legal developments.
*   **Housing Market Conditions:** As a housebuilder, Persimmon's stock is sensitive to changes in the housing market, such as interest rates, government policies, and consumer confidence.
*   **Economic Data:** Broader economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, and employment figures can impact investor sentiment towards housing-related stocks.
*   **Analyst Ratings:** Changes in ratings from financial analysts can influence how investors view the stock.
*   **Global Events:** Major global events or geopolitical uncertainties can also have an impact on the stock market as a whole.

Based on the search results, here are some pieces of information that could be related to the stock change:

*   **Positive Outlook (January 2025):** In January 2025, Persimmon released a trading statement that showed completions were up, and they expected pre-tax profits to be at the higher end of market expectations. This positive news could have had a continued impact on the stock price.
*   **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The housing market, and therefore Persimmon's stock, is sensitive to interest rate changes. Any news or speculation about interest rate changes could affect the stock price.
*   **Overall Market Sentiment:** The FTSE 100 was mainly trading lower on January 14, 2025, but Persimmon was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 that day.

HLN,Haleon plc,Healthcare,$34.4B,"Haleon PLC is a British multinational consumer healthcare company that manufactures and sells over-the-counter medicines, oral health products, vitamins, and supplements.
",397.8,4.03,"On February 28, 2025, Haleon PLC experienced a stock change of 3.77%.

While a 4.03% change seems significant, it's important to note the following context from the search results:

*   **February 27, 2025 News:** Haleon's shares actually slid about 3% on February 27th after the company announced that its revenue growth for 2025 would be weighted towards the second half of the year. This was despite the company beating Q4 organic growth estimates. The forecast of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth for the year, while solid, was a bit lower than the average analyst estimate.
*   **Analyst Perspectives:** Analysts noted that investors might be focusing on Haleon's ability to expand margins in 2025 after three years of decline.
*   **JP Morgan's Underweight Recommendation:** JP Morgan maintained an underweight recommendation for Haleon and only raised the target price slightly.

Therefore, while there was a positive change in stock price on February 28, 2025, it's essential to consider the preceding day's decline and the factors influencing investor sentiment. The slightly lower-than-expected revenue growth forecast for 2025 and focus on margin expansion seem to be key drivers.
