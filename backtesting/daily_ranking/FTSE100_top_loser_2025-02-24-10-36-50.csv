ANTO,Antofagasta plc,Basic Materials,$16.7B,"Antofagasta plc is a UK-based copper mining company with interests in transport and its core business is mining, mainly in Chile.
",1776.0,-2.42,"Unfortunately, I don't have enough specific information to pinpoint the exact reason for the -2.42% stock price change for Antofagasta plc on February 24, 2025.

Here's what I can tell you based on recent news:

*   **General Performance:** Antofagasta had a strong performance in 2024, with revenue up 5% and increased copper prices. They are maintaining stable production guidance for 2025.
*   **Positive Indicators:** Recent reports (mid-February 2025) highlight strong revenue growth, cash flow, and widened EBITDA margins for Antofagasta.
*   **Analyst Views:** At the end of January 2025, an analyst suggested a potential upside for the company's stock.
*   **Dividend:** A final dividend of 23.5 cents/share was proposed.

To understand the specific cause of the stock price change on February 24, 2025, you would need to consult real-time financial news sources for any specific announcements or market factors that may have influenced the stock that day.

ENT,Entain Plc,Consumer Cyclical,$4.7B,"Entain PLC is a global sports betting and gaming company operating online and in retail, with brands like Ladbrokes and Coral.
",723.2,-2.01,"On February 24, 2025, Entain Plc experienced a stock change of -2.01%. While I do not have enough information to provide definitive reasons for this specific change, I can offer some context and potential contributing factors based on recent news:

*   **CEO Departure:** On February 11, 2025, Entain announced the sudden departure of CEO Gavin Isaacs ""by mutual agreement"" after only five months in the role. This news caused the shares to plunge more than 10% at the time, raising concerns among investors about the company's long-term direction.
*   **Interim Leadership:** Following Isaacs' departure, Stella David, the company's non-executive Chair, stepped in as interim CEO. While David's familiarity with Entain's operations may provide some stability, the leadership change introduces uncertainty.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Some analysts have expressed concerns that the leadership uncertainty could weigh on investor sentiment.
*   **Citigroup:** Citigroup raised Entain's price target to 1,100 (1,050) pence with a 'buy' rating.

In addition to these factors, it's important to consider the company's fundamentals and overall performance:

*   **Financial Performance:** Entain has reiterated its FY24 EBITDA guidance and expects to be at the top of the £1,040m-£1,090m range. Further details on Entain's FY24 results and current trading will be provided on March 6, 2025.
*   **Long-Term Challenges:** Entain has faced challenges in recent years, with a 56% decline in share price over the past three years.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Despite the share price decline, Entain's revenue has increased by 9.7% over the three years.

It's worth noting that the stock market is influenced by various factors, and a single day's change may not necessarily indicate a long-term trend.

Based on the available information, here's a breakdown of factors concerning IHG:

*   **Stock Decrease:** IHG's stock price is down 2.0% today.
*   **Director Buys ADRs:** Non-Executive Director Byron Grote purchased 500 American depositary receipts (ADRs) on Friday of last week, worth $63,575.
*   **FY24 Results:** InterContinental Hotels Group PLC reported a profit decrease in its fiscal year 2024, despite revenue increase. However, the board proposed a 10% dividend increase and announced a $900 million share buyback program. The company is targeting average compound growth in adjusted earnings per share of 12%-15% over the medium to long term.
*   **Acquisition:** IHG acquired the Ruby brand and related intellectual property for approximately $116 million.
*   **Overall Performance:** The 12-month change in the company's stock is up 12%.

It's important to note that pinpointing the exact cause of a daily stock fluctuation is difficult without deeper analysis. However, the combination of the FY24 results announcement and the general market conditions could be contributing factors.
