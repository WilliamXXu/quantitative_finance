*   **Raised their full-year margin outlook:** Halma now expects an adjusted EBIT margin modestly above 21% for the full year to March 2025, compared to prior guidance of around 21%.
*   **Reported strong second-half demand:** The company cited strong second-half demand as a contributing factor to the improved outlook.
*   **On track for record profit:** Halma is on track for its 22nd consecutive year of record adjusted profit.
*   **Revenue Growth:** The Group's organic revenue growth has been supported by order intake which remains ahead of both revenue in the year to date and the comparable period last year.

These factors have pleased investors, contributing to the rise in the company's stock price.

One potential headwind mentioned in the reports is that the appreciation of Sterling is expected to have a negative currency translation effect on the Group's results.
