**Where to Find the Specific Reason:**

*   **Financial News Outlets:** Check major financial news sources (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal) for articles specifically mentioning IAG stock today. Look for headlines or stories discussing factors affecting the airline industry or IAG in particular.

*   **Stock Market Analysis Sites:** Websites like Investing.com, MarketWatch, or Yahoo Finance often provide news summaries and analysis of stock movements.

**Potential Factors That Could Influence IAG's Stock Price:**

*   **Overall Market Trends:** A general downturn in the stock market or the airline sector could drag IAG shares down with it.
*   **Company-Specific News:**
    *   **Earnings Reports:** The release of annual or quarterly earnings reports can significantly impact stock prices. (Note: IAG released its full year 2024 financial results on February 28, 2025 [2, 11] which could still be influencing the stock price.)

    *   **Competition:** Increased competition from other airlines could put pressure on IAG's stock.
*   **Economic Factors:**
    *   **Economic Slowdown:** Concerns about a recession or slowdown in economic growth could lead to decreased travel and lower airline stock values.
    *   **Currency Fluctuations:** As an international company, IAG's stock can be affected by currency exchange rate changes.
*   **Analyst Ratings:** Changes in stock ratings from financial analysts (upgrades or downgrades) can influence investor sentiment.

**Based on the search results, here are some specific items that might be relevant:**

*   **Share Buyback Program:** IAG launched a €500 million share buyback tranche [2]. Share buybacks can sometimes positively influence stock price, but the effect isn't guaranteed.

*   **Analyst Ratings:** Analyst recommendations can move stock prices [7].

",789.0,6.05,"On March 3, 2025, Rolls-Royce Holdings plc experienced a significant stock price change. Here's a breakdown of what likely happened and the factors contributing to it:

**Reasons for the Stock Increase:**

*   **Positive Financial Results and Future Outlook:** Rolls-Royce has shown strong performance, exceeding market expectations. Their full-year revenue rose 16% to £17.8 billion, and underlying operating profit jumped 55% to £2.5 billion. Free cash flow nearly doubled to £2.4 billion.

*   **Upgraded Mid-Term Targets:** The company upgraded its mid-term (2028) guidance for underlying operating profit and free cash flow, expecting them to reach £3.6-3.9 billion and £4.2-4.5 billion, respectively.
*   **Analyst Upgrades:** Bank of America lifted its price target for Rolls-Royce, based on the company's mid-term guidance and buyback surprise.
