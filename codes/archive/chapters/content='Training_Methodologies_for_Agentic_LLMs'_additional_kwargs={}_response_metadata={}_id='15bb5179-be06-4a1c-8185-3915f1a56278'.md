 # Training Methodologies for Agentic LLMs

In this chapter, we delve into the training methodologies that are essential for developing Agentic Language Learning Models (LLMs). These models aim to create AI agents capable of learning and adapting in complex, dynamic environments.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning approach where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. For example, consider training an LLM to play chess. The agent will take actions like moving pieces and receive rewards based on the game's outcome (e.g., winning or losing). Over time, the agent learns from its experiences and improves its decision-making skills.

üåê Practical Example: AlphaGo, a reinforcement learning model developed by DeepMind, learned to play Go at a superhuman level by playing millions of games against itself. This demonstrates the power of RL in training agentic LLMs.

## Imitation Learning (IL)

Imitation Learning involves learning from demonstrations provided by a human or another agent. In this approach, an LLM is trained to mimic the behavior it observes. For instance, teaching an LLM to play tennis by showing it videos of professional matches and rewarding it for correctly imitating the observed actions.

```markdown
üåê Practical Example: Nao robot, a humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics, was trained using Imitation Learning to perform various tasks such as serving drinks or helping elderly people. This shows how IL can be applied in real-world scenarios involving agentic LLMs.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning is a technique where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a different but related task. For example, if we have an LLM trained to understand simple commands like "open the door" or "turn on the light," we can fine-tune it to comprehend more complex sentences in a similar context. This approach saves time and resources compared to training a model from scratch for each new task.

```markdown
üåê Practical Example: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular pre-trained LLM that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Transfer Learning in training agentic LLMs.
